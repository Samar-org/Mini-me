Final Sale: All sales are considered final at the time of pick up if you had the opportunity to check the item in-store.
Exceeded Timeframe: Any return request made after the 3-day guarantee period will NOT be accepted.

“As Is” or “Not Inspected/Untested” Items: Items with these terms in the title are not eligible for returns.
Discrepancy between Photo and Description: You must refer ONLY to the description for details like quantity, color, and size. Discrepancies between the photo and description are not grounds for a return.
Buyers’ Remorse or Incorrect Fit: You cannot return items simply because you changed your mind or the item doesn’t fit if it was described correctly.
Packaging Imperfections: Damage to the packaging (dents, rips, crumpled corners) is not a valid reason for return.
Seller Approval: All sales are subject to the seller’s approval, which could potentially impact refund eligibility.
